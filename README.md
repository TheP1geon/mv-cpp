## Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is to create a functional virtual machine and programming language while learning and experimenting with language design, virtual machine architecture, and low-level programming concepts.

## Getting Started

Dependencies

- Make
- gcc

For Debian like distros: ```sudo apt-get install make gcc```

1. Clone the repo: ```git clone https://www.github.com/TheP1geon/mv```
2. Change the INLCUDE_PATH in main.c to the full path of the include folder of the repo
3. Compile with the makefile ```make```
4. [Write](#writing-your-own-programs) your own program or use one of the examples
5. Run: ```./mv <program> [-debug]```

## Writing Your Own Programs

1. Make a new file ending in ".mv"
2. Write the program (see the [Docs](https://github.com/TheP1geon/mv/blob/main/docs.md))
3. Save the file
4. Run the program with the compiled vm

## Examples

```mv
include "std.mv" ;; Inlcude the standard library which only has one function

str "Hello World!"
dupe 0 ;; Duplicate the pointer
pop 0 ;; Pop it into register 0
add ;; add the pointer to the length of the string
mem_write . 10 ;; Write at that address, 10. A newline character 
pop ;; pop the pointer
mov 0 ;; move the value from register 0 onto the stack
call print_str ;; Expects the pointer on the top of the stack
```

Prints "Hello World!" with a newline to the standard output

```
Hello World!
```

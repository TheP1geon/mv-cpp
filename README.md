## Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is to create a functional virtual machine and programming language while learning and experimenting with language design, virtual machine architecture, and low-level programming concepts.

## Getting Started

Dependencies

- Make
- gcc

1. Clone the repo: ```git clone https://www.github.com/TheP1geon/mv```
2. Change the INLCUDE_PATH in main.c to the full path of the include folder of the repo
3. Compile with the makefile ```make```
4. [Write](#writing-your-own-programs) your own program or use one of the examples
5. Run: ```./bin/mv <program> [debug]```

## Writing Your Own Programs

1. Make a new file ending in ".mv"
2. Write the program (see the [Docs](https://github.com/TheP1geon/mv-cpp/blob/main/docs.md))
3. Save the file
4. Run the program with the compiled vm

## Examples

```vasm
import "std.mv" # Include the standard library

str "Hello World!" | p # create a new string in memory and set p to the ptr
call print_str p # Pushes p onto the stack before calling print_str
```

Prints "Hello World!" with a newline to the standard output

```
Hello World!
```

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to the project. Be sure to:

- Clearly describe the changes made
- Test the changes to ensure they don't introduce new issues
- Follow the project's coding style and guidelines

## Quick Start

Run:
```bash
make
bin/mv app.mv
```
Compile the virtual machine and read the file "app.mv"
